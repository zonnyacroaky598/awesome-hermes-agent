# Awesome Hermes Agent

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of skills, tools, integrations, and resources for enhancing your [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) workflow — the self-improving AI agent built by [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com).

Hermes Agent is the only agent with a built-in learning loop — it creates skills from experience, improves them during use, searches its own past conversations, and builds a deepening model of who you are across sessions. Run it on a $5 VPS, a GPU cluster, or serverless infrastructure. Talk to it from Telegram while it works on a cloud VM.

This list tracks the growing ecosystem around it.

> Ecosystem status (last reviewed: 2026-04-03)
> - Hermes Agent: [v0.6.0 (v2026.3.30)](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases/tag/v2026.3.30)
> - Core repo: [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) (23k+ stars)
> - Latest release notes: [Hermes releases](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/releases)

## Where Do I Start?

New to Hermes? Don't try to install everything at once. Here's the three-step path from zero to productive:

1. **Get running** — Follow the [Official Docs quickstart](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/). It covers installation, CLI, configuration, and your first conversation.
2. **Add your first skills** — Install [wondelai/skills](https://github.com/wondelai/skills) (380+ stars, actively maintained) — a cross-platform skills library that works with Hermes and other agents. Or try [litprog-skill](https://github.com/tlehman/litprog-skill) (75+ stars) for literate programming across Claude Code, OpenCode, and Hermes.
3. **Get a GUI** — Set up [hermes-workspace](https://github.com/outsourc-e/hermes-workspace) (500+ stars) for a Hermes-native workspace with chat, terminal, and skills manager. Or use [mission-control](https://github.com/builderz-labs/mission-control) (3.7k+ stars) for a broader agent orchestration dashboard with fleet management, task dispatch, and cost tracking.

Once you're comfortable, explore the full list below. Every resource is tagged with a maturity level so you know what you're getting into:

| Tag | What it means |
|-----|---------------|
| **production** | Stable, documented, actively maintained — safe to build on |
| **beta** | Works but still evolving — expect some rough edges |
| **experimental** | Proof of concept or early-stage — learn from it, don't depend on it |

---

## Operational Playbooks

> Practical workflow patterns that repeatedly help Hermes teams in production.

- **Nightly self-evolution + guardrail evaluation** — Run [hermes-agent-self-evolution](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent-self-evolution) on a schedule, then run a second verification cron to score quality and block optimization-loop gaming.
- **Memory pressure handling with Honcho/Hindsight** — If you are repeating context or losing long-term recall, review [Honcho Memory docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/honcho), and evaluate [hindsight](https://github.com/vectorize-io/hindsight) or self-hosted memory backends.
- **Tune session timeout/expiry early** — Use [configuration docs](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/configuration/) to adjust session retention for slower-moving threads so context is kept when needed.
- **OpenClaw side-by-side migration** — Keep both systems running during migration using [openclaw-to-hermes](https://github.com/0xNyk/openclaw-to-hermes) and native Hermes migration paths, then cut over once cron and routing behavior match.
- **Curate USER.md and MEMORY.md intentionally** — Treat profile memory as high-signal infrastructure. Keep entries concise, durable, and preference-focused instead of dumping raw notes.
